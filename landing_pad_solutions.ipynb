    "\"You are managing a spaceport on the Moon, where spaceships from various parts of the galaxy arrive and depart. Each spaceship lands at a specific time to refuel before continuing its journey to distant planets. While refueling, a spaceship requires a landing pad, and no two spaceships can occupy the same landing pad simultaneously. Your task is to determine the minimum number of landing pads required at the spaceport to ensure that no spaceship has to wait for a pad to become available. You are given an integer n which represents the number of spaceships, and a landings and departures lists which hold those respective ships landing and departure times in 24-format. The output will be an integer representing the minimum number of landing pads required so that no spaceship needs to wait for a pad.\""

    "## Solution Description:\n",
    "The brute force approach begins by iterating through the 2400 time range. We initialize the current_pads to 0 (will be explained why later). In the for loop, we check our ship's landing and departure time to see if the current minute is between those times, including the time itself. We will increment the current_pads by 1 when the minute falls between the landing and the departure time. If the current_pads is greater than our max_pads_required, we set the max_pads_required to our current_pads. This allows us to set our current_pads back to 0 for the next iteration of our while loop and check the next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop will always run for 2401 iterations, with the for loop inside running for 0 to n-1. This means that the total iterations would be 2401 x n. The asymptotic time complextiy will be O(n) as the constant time will be disregarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize loop invariants to prove the correctness of the min_landing_pads function. The function calculates the maximum number of landing pads needed at any minute from 0 to 2400 based on the provided landing and departure times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Invariant:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each iteration of the while loop, max_pads holds the maximum number of landing pads required for all minutes from 0 to i.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the first iteration (when i = 0):\n",
    "\n",
    "max_pads is initialized to 0\n",
    "Since there are no landings or departures considered yet, the invariant trivially holds that the max pads needed from 0 to 0 is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the invariant holds at the beginning of iteration i. This means the max_pads correctly indicates the max number of pads required from time 0 to i.\n",
    "During an iteration, we calculate the current_pads for minute i:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop iterates through each landing/departure pair, and if a landing occurs at or before minute i, and a departure occurs at or after minute i, it increments current_pads\n",
    "\n",
    "After checking all pairs, the current_pads is compared against max_pads, setting the max_pads to current_pads if current_pads is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by the end of the iteration, max_pads will have the maximum number of pads required from 0 to i+1, maintining the loop invariant for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop goes until it i reaches 2401. When the loop terminates, max_pads will have the maximum number of landing pads needed over the range of times from 0 to 2400. Therefore, upon exiting the loop, max_pads will correctly indicate the max number of landing pads needed at any minute of the day."

    "## Solution Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy approach solution utilizes a selection procedure that iterates through the entire timeline of events, tracking the required resources at any given moment. We start by sorting both the landing and departure times, which achieves a systematic approach to managing the overlapping events.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the feasibility check phase, we initialize current_pads to 0 and set max_pads to 0. We use two pointers, one for the landings (i) and one for the departures (j). As we traverse through the sorted lists, we evaluate whether a landing occurs before the next departure. If it does, we increment current_pads, reflecting the need for an additional landing pad. If current_pads exceeds max_pads, we update max_pads accordingly to track the peak requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the solution check ensures that we continue processing until all landings and departures are accounted for. We loop through the events, decrementing current_pads whenever a departure occurs, and moving the pointers as necessary. At the end of this process, we return max_pads, which represents the maximum number of landing pads required at any point during the event timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time complexity involves the sorting algorithm. Sorting both landings and departures in arrays usually takes O(nlogn) time for each array. Therefore, O(nlogn) + O(nlogn) = O(nlogn). We then have a while loop that iterates at worst n times for each landing and departure (i < n and j < n), which equates to O(n). When combining these two, the O(nlogn) will grow faster than O(n), so we equate the asymptotic complexity to O(nlogn).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use loop invariant on the main while loop of the min_landing_pads_greedy function. It will show that the function correctly maintains and updates current_pads and max_pads as it iterates through the landings and departures lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Invariant:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each iteration, the current_pads represents the number of active pads in use and the max_pads represents the max number of landing pads used at any point up to the current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the loop begins, current_pads, max_pads, i, and j all = 0. This correctly reflects that no planes have landed or departed yet, and therefore no pads are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "If statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition checks to see if landings[i] < departures[j]. It signals that the next event in time is a landing, and increments current_pads by 1 since we will need another pad for the new ship. It then updates max_pads to be the maximum of max_pads and current_pads. This confirms that max_pads will always be the highest number of pads in use. It then increments the landing to move onto the next ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Else:\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition signals that the next event in time is a departure. We decrement the current_pads by 1 since a pad will no longer be in use. We then move to the next departure by incrementing j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both conditions correctly update current_pads based on if the plane lands or departs, max_pads will always hold the highest number of current_pads reached, maintaining the invariant acrosse each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop terminates when i=n (all landings processed) or when j=n (all departures processed). Once the loop ends, all landing events and departures would be accounted for. The current_pads will reset to 0 to show that all ships have departed. max_pads will accurately hold the minimum number of landing pads needed as it will be representative of the most amount of pads occupied at a single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining the loop invariant throughout each iteration, we conclude that max_pads correctly holds the minimum number of landing pads needed so no ship will have to wait for a pad. Thus, the correctness of the function is proven."

    "## Solution Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The divide and conquer approach begins by defining the function with parameters for the number of flights, their landing times, and departure times. In the initial step, we create an empty list to hold events, then iterate through the flights to generate two events for each: one for landing and one for departure. This represents our division step. We then sort the events based on their timestamps, ensuring that departures are prioritized over landings if they occur simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conquer step is encapsulated in a recursive function that processes the events in segments. It divides the events into two halves, computes the maximum number of pads required for each half, and merges the results. During the merging process, we track the current number of pads in use and update the maximum as we process each event from both halves. Finally, we combine the results from the left and right halves to determine the overall maximum number of landing pads needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function begins by creating events for landing and departure in two separate lists, using 2n complexity. We can bound this to O(n) time. The list of events is then sorted based on time and time, taking O(nlogn) time (typical sorting algorithm). The recursive function begins the divide and conquer approach by spliting the list of events in half, therefore creating a O(logn) time complexity. At each level of recursion, the code iterates through the events to count the pads, resulting in a linear O(n) time for each level. Therefore the total time complexity for the recursion is O(nlogn). In the merge step, we merge the results from the two halves, taking O(n) time. The overall time complexity when accounting for each step in the divide and conquer approach will be O(nlogn), since it is the highest bound.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a loop invariant on the merge process within recursive_max_pads. This will show that current_pads and merge_max are correctly updated to track the active pads and peak pads needed at any point as we iterate through the combined list of landing and departure events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Invariant:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each iteration in the merge process, current_pads represents the number of active pads currently in use, and merge_max represents the highest count of pads required at any point up to the current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the merge loop starts, current_pads and merge_max are set to the maximum pads in the left and right halves of events (left_max and right_max). This setup reflects the maximum pads observed so far in each half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maintenance:\n",
    "\n",
    "If events[i][0] < events[j][0]:\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition means the next event in time is a landing. The code increments current_pads by 1, as one more pad is needed, and updates merge_max. Then, i increments to move onto the next event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Else:\n",
    "\n",
    "This signals that the next event is a departure. We decrement current_pads by 1, as a pad is freed up, and increment j to process the next departure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each condition correctly updates current_pads based on landing or departure events, merge_max will always hold the highest value of current_pads reached, maintaining the invariant across each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop terminates when all events in both halves are processed. At this point, merge_max holds the maximum pads required for the combined events, which represents the highest number of pads in use at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining the loop invariant throughout each iteration, we conclude that merge_max correctly holds the minimum number of landing pads required, proving the correctness of the function."

    "\n",
    "Comparing the input sizes and processing times of brute-force, greedy, and divide-and-conquer algorithms, we can analyze their execution times across a range of input sizes and visualize the improvements advanced techniques provide over brute-force.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brute Force Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time Pattern: Execution times increase dramatically with input size, even for moderate sizes. This increase results from brute force’s inefficient handling of each time unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(2401×n), reveals that as input size doubles, the execution time scales accordingly, leading to impractical durations for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: While simple, brute force is unsuitable for larger datasets due to its inefficiency in processing times, especially when compared to the other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time Pattern: This approach maintains the fastest execution times across all input sizes, increasing only slightly as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(nlogn), the greedy algorithm offers a much more efficient approach than brute force, scaling well even for larger inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: The greedy approach’s minimal processing time per input size makes it ideal for real-time or larger-scale scheduling problems, where efficiency is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide and Conquer Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time Pattern: Execution times fall between those of brute force and greedy, with a moderate increase as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(nlogn), the divide-and-conquer approach performs more efficiently than brute force, but it may have a slightly higher overhead than greedy due to recursive processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: This approach effectively balances processing speed with scalability, making it suitable for larger inputs where recursive splitting and merging of events are effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improvements from Advanced Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from brute-force to greedy or divide-and-conquer yields substantial improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy approach dramatically reduces execution time, leveraging efficient sorting and sequential processing to handle events. It provides the fastest performance across all input sizes tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide and conquer is particularly advantageous for large datasets, reducing the overhead of sequential processing by dividing tasks recursively, allowing it to scale effectively.\n",
